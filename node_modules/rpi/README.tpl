# rpi [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xseignard/rpi.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xseignard/rpi)

Yet another Node.js library to use the Raspberry Pi GPIOs.

Relies on [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/) and then has some nice features:
- no sudo required
- you can use the GPIOs from the P5 header of the Pi
- based on [Event Emitters](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html)

It's a WIP! But basic read and write should work. See the `examples` folder.
